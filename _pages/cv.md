Education
======

*  2015-2019, Ph.D. in Signal and Image Processing, IMAGES/LTCI, Télécom ParisTech
*  2012–2015, Master of Science, Department of Spatial Information and Digital Technology, China University of Mining
and Technology (CUMT)
*  2008–2012, Bachelor of Science, Department of Spatial Information and Digital Technology, CUMT (Ranking : 4/160)



Vocational experience
======
* December 2020 - Present, **Machine learning researcher**, Deep Planet, LONDON, UK 
    * Using AttentionU-Net and high-resolution opticalremote sensing images to find Frankincense trees in
    the Somaliland, with a small number of training sets, the detection accuracy can reach 90%. This task
    was completed in cooperation with researchers from a computer vision group at Oxford University.
    * Multi-sensor time series missing value imputation with attention Conv-BiLSTM network. With the processed data, we can monitor vegetation with high-precision (10m) and high-frequency (5 days) data
    during the rainy season.
    * Improved the Savitzky-golay time series filtering method. The improved method allows us to retain
    useful temporal features.
    * Based on historical yield information, we used the Random Forest method to forecast the yield of
    grapes.

* July 2019 - November 2020, **Research Fellow**, University College London, LONDON, UK
    * Time series missing value imputation (regression, RF, LSTM/BiLSTM) with multisensor data
    * Multisensor time-series images (SAR/optical) fusion with 3D coherent radiative transfer model
    * Time-series forecasting with dual-stage attention-based RNNs
    * Algorithm evaluation over Google Cloud

* May 2015 - November 2015, **Research assistant**, The Chinese University of Hong Kong, HONG KONG, China
    * Time-series images processing and software development
    * Phase unwrapping with Minimum Cost Flow (MCF) optimization method
