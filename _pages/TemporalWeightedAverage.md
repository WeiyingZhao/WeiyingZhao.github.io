With the launching of a new generation of SAR systems, a large amount of SAR data is now available. One of the oldest ways to exploit
a multitemporal series is temporal multilooking. We proposed two schemes for introducing the temporal information
into the spatially based SAR image denoising methods: adaptive nonlocal temporal filter (ANLTF) and patch based adaptive temporal filter (PATF).

Figure 1. Different denoising results comparison based on 64 resampled (step 2)
Sentinel-1 images : denoising results (left), ratio with noisy data (middle) and residual
evaluation results (right). There are changed building areas in the middle of the image.
The residual evaluation results have been classified into 4 classes with display value range
[0, 4] and red color represents the larger values.
