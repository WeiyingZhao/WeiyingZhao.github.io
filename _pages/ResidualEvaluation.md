The evaluation method proposed here follows the idea presented in [Riot et al., 2017]
which examines the residual image and looks for possible remaining structural elements
in this residual image. Unlike maximum ENL estimation or αβ estimation [Gomez
et al., 2016] method, this method is automatic and does not rely on a supervised
selection of homogeneous regions. It also provides a global score for the whole image.
