# 1. Propose an autocovariance based denoising performance evaluation method

This evaluation method follows the idea presented in [Riot et al., 2017]
which examines the residual image and looks for possible remaining structural elements
in this residual image. Unlike maximum ENL estimation or αβ estimation [Gomez
et al., 2016] method, this method is automatic and does not rely on a supervised
selection of homogeneous regions. It also provides a global score for the whole image. It is very useful for the denoising performance evaluation of SAR images without ground truth.

# 2. Long time series SAR image denoising and change detection

Related paper will be prepared and released.

# 3. Deep learning based change detection

Some ground truth has been prepared based on well registered Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images.
