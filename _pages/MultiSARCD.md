To mining different change profiles, we propose several methods to detect the changed area, change magnitude, change classes and changed time. 

This work is suppervised by [Florence Tupin](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/) and [Henri Ma√Ætre](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/maitre/).

# 1. Change area detection

## 1.1 Method introduction

Based on RABASAR provided data which have spatial varying ENL, we propose a simplified log-likelihood ratio test method. During the test, chi-squared distributed probability function is utilized to theoretically define the false alarm rate.
