To mining different change profiles, we propose several methods to detect the changed area, change magnitude, change classes and changed time. 

This work is suppervised by [Florence Tupin](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/) and [Henri MaÃ®tre](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/maitre/).

# 1. Change area detection



Based on RABASAR provided data which have spatial varying ENL, we propose a simplified generalized log-likelihood ratio test (SGLR) method assuming that corresponding temporal pixels have the same equivalent number of looks (ENL). During the test, chi-squared  probability distribution function is utilized to theoretically define the false alarm rate.

# 2. Change magnitude detection

To distinguish  appearing and disappearing changes, we used a signum function sign(x) to convert SGLR values to corresponding positive values when x > 0 and negative values when x < 0. In this case, if we set the image acquired at time t as the reference image, the positive and negative values correspond to the increase and decrease of the object backscattering values.

The thresholds chosen for column (b) with Pfa=0.54% and Pfa=1% for column (c). The time intervals of the changes are shown above. Different colors  represent the decrease and increase of the backscattering values. The temporal images are denoised using RABASAR-DAM method.
