To mining different change profiles, we propose several methods to detect the changed area, change magnitude, change classes and changed time. 

This work is suppervised by [Florence Tupin](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/tupin/) and [Henri Ma√Ætre](https://perso.telecom-paristech.fr/maitre/).

# 1. Change area detection



Based on RABASAR provided data which have spatial varying ENL, we propose a simplified generalized log-likelihood ratio test (SGLR) method assuming that corresponding temporal pixels have the same equivalent number of looks (ENL). During the test, chi-squared distributed probability function is utilized to theoretically define the false alarm rate.
